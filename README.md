# AnnualReviewNote-Java-CapstoneProject

## Hello everyone !

Every end of year a lot of employees struggle to write their annual review. A personal annual review is an opportunity to step back and take stock of your successes, failures, and learnings from the past 12 months.

To overcome this problem **Annual Review Notes** has been created. The purpose of this application is to help any employee working in information technology who would like to keep track of all their tasks per sprint during the year.

Annual Review Notes is a Capstone project created by *Boty Koutouan*.

The main objective of this project was to deepen my knowledge in Java which is the main programming language used for the back-end side. Also, a desire to create a project linked to a database was one of my goals. To develop the project I used a Spring Boot Application, a Java framework and built the system with Maven.

The learning I experienced during this project has been phenomenal for my growth as someone transitioning in programming languages; who started in July 2022 learning coding through Hackbright Academy sponsored by Optum. I enjoyed learning and gained more knowledge on how to create the access layers to interact with the database and connect them with the front end.

Thanks for stopping here to check out my Annual Review Notes. Have a great time here!
